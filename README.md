# ECMAScript fundamentals

# Topics

  * New syntax and operators
  * Language primitives including sets, maps, and iterators

# Overview
This talk aims to give an overview of the new syntax, operators, and primitives in ECMAScript. We present some of the new syntax, such as `const`, `let`, and `fat arrow`, as well as new ways that simplify looping over collections. I also cover new object primitives (sets and maps), as well as promises: what they are and how you can use them to write cleaner, more comprehensible and maintainable async code. 

# Target Audience
This is a beginner level tutrial for Web/Node developers. However, it assumes you know a bit about ECMAScript/JavaScript already.
