# ECMAScript fundamentals

 * [Presentation slides](http://jsworkshops.github.io/fundamentals/presentation/).
 * [Tutorial](tutorial/)

## Overview
This talk aims to give an overview of the new syntax, operators, and primitives in ECMAScript. We present some of the new syntax, such as `const`, `let`, and fat arrow (`=>`), as well as new ways that simplify looping over collections. I also cover new object primitives (sets and maps), as well as promises: what they are and how you can use them to write cleaner, more comprehensible and maintainable async code.

### Topics

  * New syntax and operators.
  * Default arguments.
  * Language primitives including sets, maps, and iterators.

### Target Audience
This is a beginner level tutorial for Web/Node developers. However, it assumes you know a bit about ECMAScript/JavaScript already.
