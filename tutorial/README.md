## Getting setup
You need, [Node 6](https://nodejs.org/en/) and the [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) testing framework.

### MacOS
Or you can install NodeJS and Mocha through the command line, if you have [brew](http://brew.sh) installed.

```Bash
brew install node
npm install -g mocha
```

### Windows
[Download the installer](https://nodejs.org/en/) and follow the prompts.

Once you have Node installed:

```Bash
npm install -g mocha
```

## Check your versions!

This is how you check what version of Node you have:

```Bash
node --version
```

It should say something greater than or equal to `v6.0.0` (e.g., v6.2.0).

Similarly with Mocha

```Bash
mocha --version
```

Should say something like 2.4.5.

## Getting the tutorials

Clone the following repository:

```Bash
git clone git@github.com:JSWorkshops/fundamentals.git
cd fundamental/tutorial
npm install
```

In you favorite editor, open up each of the exercises.
