# Getting setup 

You need, Node 6. You can grab it from [NodeJS.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) as well as Mocha (a testing framework which we will use). 

Or you can install node through the command line, if you have [brew](http://brew.sh) installed. 

```Bash
brew install node
```

## Check your versions!

This is how you check what version of Node you have:

```Bash
node --version
```

It should say something greater than or equal to `v6.0.0` (e.g., v6.2.0).

Similarly with Mocha

```Bash
mocha --version
```

Should say something like 2.4.5.
