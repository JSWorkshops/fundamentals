## Getting setup
You need, [Node 6](https://nodejs.org/en/).

 * [Download the installer](https://nodejs.org/en/) and follow the prompts.

Or use your favorite package manager to get it (e.g., (HomeBrew)[http://brew.sh/] on MacOS, [apt-get](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool) on Linux). 

## Check your Node version!
This is how you check what version of Node you have:

```Bash
node --version
```

It should say something greater than or equal to `v6.0.0` (e.g., v6.2.1).

## Getting the tutorials

Clone the following repository and run npm install:

```Bash
git clone git@github.com:JSWorkshops/fundamentals.git
npm install
```

This will install Mocha + Chai (a testing framework), which we will use to complete the excercises.  

## Now what? 
In you favorite editor, open up each of the exercises. Try to solve each problem. We will go through them together in the tutorial.
